# ip : 
=======
ip is the logical number of any device that's unique and communicate with internet by connect with your home router.
suppose my router ip => 192.168.0.1 ,if I'm hit with browser then I can goto my router admin panel . 


#switch:
--------
in switch connect your home devices and communicate each other . suppose 4 computer connect with a switch . and switch connect with router. 
switch is work in small network like Lan, Wan . 

Router: 
----------
Home network Lan / Wan connect with internet by router . my phone connect with router at inter network and my route connect inter-network 
to outer-network (whole world). Router have a default getway or ip address => 192.168.0.1 this ip for home network DNS/getway . router also have
public ip to connect internet directly . Inner network device communicate by router public ip address. my router public ip => 72.14.301.130 

Subnet: (sub-network)
--------
Suppose 2 device connect with my router . pc => 192.168.0.2 , mobile =>192.168.4.3 that's connect with router .  Router ip (getway)=>
192.168.0.1 , subnet indicate the common flag (common number = 255). 192.168 is common for my home network . so , subnet will be 
255.255.0.0  (common_number_of_ip.common_number_of_ip.uncommon_ip.uncommon_ip). 

if my devices ip => 192.168.0.2, 192.168.0.3 then the subnet will be => 255.255.255.0 (range of ip sub network);

Route 4 core funtionality : 
----------------------
1. NAT : NAT stands for Network Address Translation, a technique that allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address.
         NAT is used by organizations and internet service providers (ISPs) to enable devices on a private network to communicate with devices on a public network.

2. DMZ : In networking, a DMZ, or demilitarized zone, is a subnetwork that protects an organization's internal network from untrusted traffic.
         It's a perimeter network that acts as a neutral territory between an organization's private network and the internet or other untrusted networks

3. FireWall : set of rules that how to communicate , home network to internet.  LAN devices how to communicate  (internet) WAN network.
              in WAN (wide area network) connect all other person devices in the internet. Firewall has 2 options 
              
              a.DMZ (De maliterize Zone): outer network device (Through internet ) can connect with my device if my device include DMZ listed.conf file. 

              b. Port Forwarding: Every application run different port . http = 80 , ftp= 21. ssh =22 . outer network device can connect with 
                 ip:port_number in my home network . my_ip:port_80 is the apahce2 server address . can show the file of var/www/http/_number_files. 

List of Ports: 
----------------
Port Number
Usage 20 => File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Data Transfer
      21 => File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Command Control
      22 => Secure Shell (SSH)
      23 => Telnet - Remote login service, unencrypted text messages
      25 => Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) E-mail Routing
      53 => Domain Name System (DNS) service
      80 => Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used in World Wide Web
      110=> Post Office Protocol (POP3) used by e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail from a server
      119=> Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)
      123=> Network Time Protocol (NTP)
      143=> Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) Management of Digital Mail
      161=> Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
      194=> Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
      443=> HTTP Secure (HTTPS) HTTP over TLS/SSL
